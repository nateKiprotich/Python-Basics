# Basic Arithmetic operator

# +,-,*,/

a = 20
b = 15

c = a + b
print(c)

# Returns the result of a division without the remainder
c = a // b
print(c)

#Modulo operator. Returns the remainder of a dision operation
c = a % b
print(c)

# Exponential operator. In the example below, a is raised to power b
c = a ** b
print(c)


# Comparison operators
"""
    == Equals to check
    != Not equals to
    < Less than
    > Greater than
    >= Greater or equals to
    <= Less or equal to
    
    These operators returns boolean (True or False)
